# Various
various problems in ranging difficulty. Most of the programs are simple focusing on fun math heavy algorithms. Most of the files are simply small side projects that I do when i'm bored. Will be continiously updating this repository when i've got new stuff laying around.

### Current small files:

1) Approximation of PI using points
2) Different ways of calculating the nth fibonacci number
3) Brent's Tortoise & Hare
