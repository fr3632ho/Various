# Various
various problems in ranging difficulty. Most of the programs are simple and focusing on fun math heavy algorithms. Most of the files are simply small side projects that I do when i'm bored. Will be continiously updating this repository when i've got new stuff laying around.

Most of the code is written in python, however, some Java is included as well.

### Current small files:

1) Approximation of PI using points in a 2D plane - [approximationOfPi.py](https://github.com/fr3632ho/Various/blob/master/src/approximationOfPi.py)
2) Different ways of calculating the nth fibonacci number - [nFibonacci.py](https://github.com/fr3632ho/Various/blob/master/src/nFibonacci.py)
3) Brent's Tortoise & Hare - [brent.py](https://github.com/fr3632ho/Various/blob/master/src/brent.py)
4) [Folder](https://github.com/fr3632ho/Various/tree/master/src/eulerproblems) containing multiple Euler problems with simple solutions
5) Express X as a sum of powers - [SumOfPowers.java](https://github.com/fr3632ho/Various/blob/master/src/SumOfPowers.java) 
6) Sum of squares on a chess board - [ChessBoard.py](https://github.com/fr3632ho/Various/blob/master/src/ChessBoard.py)
